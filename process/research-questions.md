I'm writing this after having struggled with Inform 7 for a while in order to put together a basic menu system (Charon and his ferry) and the Sisyphus scene of the game. So this is not really pre-development hypothesizing, but them's the break.

## Translation across media: Using Inform 7

Boring, but yes this once again fits into my ongoing interest in what happens when you take a game design or "game" and try to remake it in a different technology. The original punishment games are in the style of track-and-field retro games. This one presents them as a text adventure.

It's already clear that this leads to really different ways of thinking about the games despite the ultimate goal of presenting the same "story":

### Narrative menu

The menu system turned out to be weirdly important in that I quickly ended up feeling like it needed to be as narrative as the rest of the game so had to come up with an actual scene rather than just buttons or selections, hence Charon and his ferry. There's something interesting about going from a list of five options to this quite fleshed-out version of a "menu".

### Text-adventure culture

The call of the text-adventure has a bunch of conventions in my mind that I can't help but want to adhere to culturally. So I have a couple of things that look very faintly like puzzles (the coin in the mouth, stealing a look at the clipboard), because text adventures have that - you want a bit of indirection as you go along I suppose. Likewise I've found that it seems necessary to have little points of interest in the world for the player to look at so it's not just totally functional - a narrative version invites that kind of telling.

### Inform 7 ontology

The ontology of Inform 7 has a genuine impact on how it feels to implement all this stuff as well. Inform 7 literally works in terms of objects, vehicles, things that open and close, walking places, getting into things, carrying things, giving things, and so on. All of these are built in and can be used to compose your experience and lend a kind of creedence and scope to the world that isn't there in previous versions of this game. There's more of a sense of being there, I think, than previously.

## Sequels: A body of evidence

Of course we have the building experiment of making the "same game" over and over. This is the ninth version of the game I've made so we have this kind of body of evidence accumulating about what different approaches to design and implementation have on a more or less constant base.

Part of this involves me asking myself the question of whether I'm trying to make games out of the original myths or whether I'm trying to make games out of the original game from 2011. I often flip flop around on this, usually landing on the idea that I'm trying to make a new game "in the spirit of" the creation of the first one. As such I don't need to make a game that mimicks the first game's qualities, but rather possesses the same kinds of connections to the original, perhaps the same tone etc. too.

At some point I suppose some larger study could be done of all of the games to make some sort of case or set of observations about game design.
