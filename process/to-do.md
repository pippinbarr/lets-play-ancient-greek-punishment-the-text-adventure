## Laws of writing IF (from Simon Christiansen)

- Always have a description for `x me`
- Always have items for all first-level nouns (e.g. things mentioned in descriptions)
- Consider having descriptions for second-level nouns (mentioned in the first-level descriptions, etc.)
- In outdoor areas think about the visibility of distant objects/scenery
