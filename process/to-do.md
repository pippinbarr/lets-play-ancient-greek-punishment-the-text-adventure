# Inform 7

- ~~Do a tutorial to get your head in the game~~
- Wonder if you'll write any to-dos for this project...

## Laws of writing IF (from Simon Christiansen)

- Always have a description for `x me`
- Always have items for all first-level nouns (e.g. things mentioned in descriptions)
- Consider having descriptions for second-level nouns (mentioned in the first-level descriptions, etc.)
- In outdoor areas think about the visibility of distant objects/scenery


## Charon

- ~~Add information about skipping (and make the command "I am X" instead to make it less likely it just gets typed anyway)~~

- Add Prometheus option

## Sisyphus

- ~~Add points (with notifications)~~

## Prometheus

- ~~Create room (rock rising out of the beach you arrive at)~~
- ~~Add description to Charon departure that includes him getting out and chaining you to the rock~~
- ~~Add idea of chains and restricted movement~~
- ~~Add writhing and synonyms + hint attached to other forms of movement (jump, go, etc)~~
- ~~Add eagle arrival~~
- ~~Add eagle pecking and reducing of liver~~
- Add eagle departure
- Add idea of making the eagle hover
- Add nightfall (room description) and liver regen
- Consider adding other stuff to look at while you're being pecked? Some kind of sub activity as with the note and hole etc.? Do I want to sprinkle this kind of thing liberally or not?
