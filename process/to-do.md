# Inform 7

- ~~Do a tutorial to get your head in the game~~
- Wonder if you'll write any to-dos for this project...

## Laws of writing IF (from Simon Christiansen)

- Always have a description for `x me`
- Always have items for all first-level nouns (e.g. things mentioned in descriptions)
- Consider having descriptions for second-level nouns (mentioned in the first-level descriptions, etc.)
- In outdoor areas think about the visibility of distant objects/scenery


## Charon

- ~~Add information about skipping (and make the command "I am X" instead to make it less likely it just gets typed anyway)~~
- ~~Add Prometheus option~~

- Add spit
- Obol falls out on talking to Charon

## Sisyphus

- ~~Add points (with notifications)~~

## Prometheus

- ~~Create room (rock rising out of the beach you arrive at)~~
- ~~Add description to Charon departure that includes him getting out and chaining you to the rock~~
- ~~Add idea of chains and restricted movement~~
- ~~Add writhing and synonyms + hint attached to other forms of movement (jump, go, etc)~~
- ~~Add eagle arrival~~
- ~~Add eagle pecking and reducing of liver~~
- ~~Add eagle departure~~
- ~~Add nightfall (room description) and liver regen~~
- ~~Add effective writhing and corresponding eagle dislodging~~

- Add things to look at (more about the eagle, the chains, the rock, the beach, the river, and further orders of nouns so there's a kind of exploration of the eye, graffiti on the rock with a lol?)

## Tantalus

- ~~Create room (pool and tree up the beach)~~
- ~~Add Charon showing you to the pool~~
- ~~Have "in the pool" going~~
- ~~No movement from the pool~~
- ~~Add the tree and the apple~~
- ~~Replace get and drink etc. for the water and the apple~~

- Add hunger and thirst system
- Add flavour texts
