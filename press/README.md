## Description

In _The Text Adventure_ the player experiences five classic tales of punishment (Sisyphus, Prometheus, Tantalus, the Danaids, and Zeno) in the form of, well, a text adventure. Unlike in previous editions in this series of games, the text adventure edition involves considerably more narrative detail and extra context thanks to the power of words. The player first must navigate an opening scene with Charon in order to cross the river Styx to their chosen punishment experience, then can explore the scene to their heart's content before getting down to the core business of being punished. The game includes a significant amount of built-in help to make it playable for those who haven't encountered parser-based interactive fiction before.

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: The Text Adventure_ is the thirteenth edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series begun in 2011 and comprising: [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishment/LetsPlayAncientGreekPunishment.html) (2011), [Art Edition Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayletsplayancientgreekpunishmentarteditionedition/) (2015), [Limited Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentlimitededition/) (2016), [CPU Edition](http://pippinbarr.github.io/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentcpuedition/) (2017), [Inversion Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-inversion-edition) (2019), [UI Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition) (2019), [Teaches Typing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing) (2019), [Chess Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition) (2019), [The Twine](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-twine/) (2019), the [Bitsy Demake](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-bitsy-demake/) (2019), [Five-in-One](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-five-in-one/) (2019), and [Competition Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-competition-edition/) (2019).

## History

_The Text Adventure_ is part of my ongoing idea of essentially spending 2019 making variations on the base _Ancient Greek Punishment_ set of minigames as a way to remain "productive" while in transition to a life with a new baby. In fact, I've ended up making a few other games this year as well, but the punishment series has been my chief focus.

I've been interested in text adventures for a fairly long time, at least since playing Zork Zero as a kid. After making my only other interactive fiction game, [Kicker](http://www.pippinbarr.com/2012/11/23/kicker/) back in 2012, the Ancient Greek Punishment series seemed like an excellent way to return to that world and to dust off Inform 7 (the tool used to create it) again. Writing interactive fiction is exceedingly difficult and the games tend to follow a basic concept of narrative plus puzzles that requires great feats design that I had no intention of really following through on, lacking the skills. Instead, I was most interested in using the basic form as a way to reinterpret the myths themselves, to explore what distinctions come up when you make these games in purely textual form (as with the [Twine edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/2019/07/03/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-twine.html)). The design and development process thus focused especially on the nature of the tool itself and how it represents a world (Inform 7 is interesting for having some quite specific categories of elements you deploy to represent a world, such as rooms, doors, containers, vehicles, etc.), and how more expansive textual descriptions can be used to color the mythical experiences in question.

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: The Text Adventure_ is also another reference point in the detailed process documentation approach called [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma). In this case, because the game is so simple, there's less documentation that I usually produce. Nonetheless, you can read a little about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-text-adventure/blob/master/process/README.md) or by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-text-adventure/commits/master).

## Excerpts

Sisyphus
```
Bottom of the Hill
A grey, gritty beach meets the edge of the river. A low, bare hill rises gently upward.

You can see a worryingly large boulder here.

> push boulder
```

Prometheus
```
The eagle lands heavily beside you. You feel an urge to thrash.

> wait
```

Tantalus
```
You're so thirsty.

> drink water
```

Danaids
```
> examine basin
A wide basin intended for holding liquid. Let's say water.

> pour water into basin
```

Zeno
```
> run north
You run furiously and cover half the distance to the flag!
```
